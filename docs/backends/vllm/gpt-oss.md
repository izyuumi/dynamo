# Running gpt-oss-120b Disaggregated with vLLM

Dynamo supports disaggregated serving of gpt-oss-120b with vLLM. This guide demonstrates how to deploy gpt-oss-120b using disaggregated prefill/decode serving on a single H100 node with 8 GPUs, running 1 prefill worker on 4 GPUs and 1 decode worker on 4 GPUs.

## Overview

This deployment uses disaggregated serving in vLLM where:
- **Prefill Worker**: Processes input prompts efficiently using 4 GPUs with tensor parallelism
- **Decode Worker**: Generates output tokens using 4 GPUs, optimized for token generation throughput
- **Frontend**: Provides OpenAI-compatible API endpoint with round-robin routing

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes readers already knows how to deploy Dynamo disaggregated serving with vLLM as illustrated in [README.md](/docs/backends/vllm/README.md)

## Instructions

### 1. Launch the Deployment

Note that GPT-OSS is a reasoning model with tool calling support. To
ensure the response is being processed correctly, the worker should be
launched with proper `--dyn-reasoning-parser` and `--dyn-tool-call-parser`.

**Start frontend**
```bash
python3 -m dynamo.frontend --http-port 8000 &
```

**Run decode worker**
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3  python -m dynamo.vllm \
  --model openai/gpt-oss-120b \
  --tensor-parallel-size 4 \
  --dyn-reasoning-parser gpt_oss \
  --dyn-tool-call-parser harmony
```

**Run prefill workers**
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=4,5,6,7  python -m dynamo.vllm \
  --model openai/gpt-oss-120b \
  --tensor-parallel-size 4 \
  --is-prefill-worker \
  --dyn-reasoning-parser gpt_oss \
  --dyn-tool-call-parser harmony
```

### 2. Verify the Deployment is Ready

Poll the `/health` endpoint to verify that both the prefill and decode worker endpoints have started:
```
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

Make sure that both of the `generate` endpoints are available before sending an inference request:
```
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "endpoints": [
    "dyn://dynamo.backend.generate"
  ],
  "instances": [
    {
      "component": "backend",
      "endpoint": "generate",
      "namespace": "dynamo",
      "instance_id": 7587889712474989333,
      "transport": {
        "nats_tcp": "dynamo_backend.generate-694d997dbae9a315"
      }
    },
    {
      "component": "prefill",
      "endpoint": "generate",
      "namespace": "dynamo",
      "instance_id": 7587889712474989350,
      "transport": {
        "nats_tcp": "dynamo_prefill.generate-694d997dbae9a326"
      }
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

If only one worker endpoint is listed, the other may still be starting up. Monitor the worker logs to track startup progress.

### 3. Test the Deployment

Send a test request to verify the deployment:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b",
    "input": "Explain the concept of disaggregated serving in LLM inference in 3 sentences.",
    "max_output_tokens": 200,
    "stream": false
  }'
```

The server exposes a standard OpenAI-compatible API endpoint that accepts JSON requests. You can adjust parameters like `max_tokens`, `temperature`, and others according to your needs.

### 4. Reasoning and Tool Calling

Dynamo has supported reasoning and tool calling in OpenAI Chat Completion endpoint. A typical workflow for application built on top of Dynamo
is that the application has a set of tools to aid the assistant provide accurate answer, and it is ususally
multi-turn as it involves tool selection and generation based on the tool result. Below is an example
of sending multi-round requests to complete a user query with reasoning and tool calling:

**Application setup (pseudocode)**
```Python
# The tool defined by the application
def get_system_health():
    for component in system.components:
        if not component.health():
            return False
    return True

# The JSON representation of the declaration in ChatCompletion tool style
tool_choice = '{
  "type": "function",
  "function": {
    "name": "get_system_health",
    "description": "Returns the current health status of the LLM runtimeâ€”use before critical operations to verify the service is live.",
    "parameters": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {}
    }
  }
}'

# On user query, perform below workflow.
def user_query(app_request):
    # first round
    # create chat completion with prompt and tool choice
    request = ...
    response = send(request)

    if response["finish_reason"] == "tool_calls":
        # second round
        function, params = parse_tool_call(response)
        function_result = function(params)
        # create request with prompt, assistant response, and function result
        request = ...
        response = send(request)
    return app_response(response)
```
