# Running Deepseek R1 with Wide EP

Dynamo supports running Deepseek R1 with data parallel attention and wide expert parallelism. Each data parallel attention rank is a seperate dynamo component that will emit its own KV Events and Metrics. vLLM controls the expert parallelism using the flag `--enable-expert-parallel`

## Instructions

The following script can be adapted to run Deepseek R1 with a variety of different configuration. The current configuration uses 2 nodes, 16 GPUs, and a dp of 16. Follow the [ReadMe](README.md) Getting Started section on each node, and then run these two commands.

node 0
```bash
./launch/dsr1_dep.sh --num-nodes 2 --node-rank 0 --gpus-per-node 8 --master-addr <node 0 addr>
```

node 1
```bash
./launch/dsr1_dep.sh --num-nodes 2 --node-rank 1 --gpus-per-node 8 --master-addr <node 0 addr>
```

### Testing the Deployment

On node 0 (where the frontend was started) send a test request to verify your deployment:

```bash
curl localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1",
    "messages": [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "In the heart of Eldoria, an ancient land of boundless magic and mysterious creatures, lies the long-forgotten city of Aeloria.
